### 1a: Write a Python function

You need to write a Python function that takes a number of positional arguments (integers) and returns both the average and the summation of those numbers.

Here is an example function:

```python
def fun(*args):
    total = sum(args)
    average = total / len(args)
    return average, total

# Examples:
print(fun(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))  # Output: (3.0, 15)
print(fun(1, 2))           # Output: (1.5, 3)
```

### 1b: Analyze the provided Python code

Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its output:

```python
addition = 0

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

output = my_list[-2:-9:-2]
print(output)

for i in output:
    if (i / 2 == 0):
        addition += i

print(addition)
```

1. `addition` is initialized to `0`.
2. `my_list` is a list of integers from `1` to `10`.
3. `output = my_list[-2:-9:-2]`:
   - This slicing operation starts from the second last element (`9`), moves backwards in steps of `-2` until the element at index `-9` (inclusive), which corresponds to the second element (`2`).
   - Hence, `output` will be `[9, 7, 5]`.
   
   Therefore, `print(output)` will print `[9, 7, 5]`.

4. The for loop iterates over the elements in `output` (`9`, `7`, `5`), but the condition `if (i / 2 == 0)` will always be `False` because dividing any of these numbers by `2` does not result in `0`.

As a result, `addition` remains `0`.

Therefore, `print(addition)` will print `0`.

### Conclusion

The final output after executing the provided code is:
```
[9, 7, 5]
0
```

### 2 a): HTML Table

To generate the table code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Product Table</title>
    <style>
        table {
            width: 50%;
            border-collapse: collapse;
        }
        table, th, td {
            border: 1px solid black;
        }
        th, td {
            padding: 10px;
            text-align: left;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Serial No.</th>
        <th>Product Name</th>
        <th>Product Price</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1.</td>
        <td>Rice</td>
        <td>150</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2.</td>
        <td>Meat</td>
        <td>350</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Total</td>
        <td>500</td>
    </tr>
</table>

</body>
</html>
```

###  2b: Object-Oriented Programming with Inheritance in Python

Here is how you can implement the classes and methods as described in the problem:

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def describe(self):
        return f"{self.year} {self.brand} {self.model}"

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year, mileage):
        super().__init__(brand, model, year)
        self.mileage = mileage

    def calculate_mileage(self):
        return self.mileage

# Example of creating a Car object and utilizing its methods
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020, 15000)
print(my_car.describe())          # Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla
print(my_car.calculate_mileage()) # Output: 15000
```

### Explanation:

1. **Main Class: Vehicle**
    - `__init__`: The initializer method takes three parameters (`brand`, `model`, and `year`) and initializes them.
    - `describe`: A method to provide a description of the vehicle, returning a formatted string with the year, brand, and model.

2. **Subclass: Car**
    - Inherits from `Vehicle`.
    - `__init__`: The initializer method for `Car` calls the initializer of the `Vehicle` class using `super()` to set the common attributes and also initializes an additional attribute, `mileage`.
    - `calculate_mileage`: A method that returns the car's mileage.

3. **Example Usage**
    - A `Car` object is created with specific attributes.
    - The `describe` method from the `Vehicle` class is used to print a description of the car.
    - The `calculate_mileage` method from the `Car` class is used to print the car's mileage.
